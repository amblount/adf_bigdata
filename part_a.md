### File Formats
This lesson described text-based formats for data, including delimited text, XML, and JSON; which are very commonly used in data processing scenarios. It also discussed file encoding, and the need to be aware of which encoding system is used for your data files.

In addition to the text formats covered in this lesson, there are some specialized file formats that are optimized for high performance in the distributed storage and processing environments typical of big data scenarios. These include formats like Avro, ORC and Parquet.

- To learn about the Avro format, see http://avro.apache.org/.
- To learn about the ORC format, see https://orc.apache.org/.
- To learn about the Parquet file format, see https://parquet.apache.org/

Working with Azure Data Stores
This lesson also introduced two core Azure services for storing data in Azure: Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Store.

- To learn more about Azure Storage, see the documentation at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/index.
- To learn more about Azure Data Lake Store, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/index.

In addition to the graphical tools shown in this lesson, you can work with Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Store using the Azure Command Line interface, a cross-platform console interface for working with Azure resources.

You can find out more about the Azure CLI, and download it for your Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X computer at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli.

- The Azure CLI documentation for working with Azure Storage is at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage.
- The Azure CLI documentation for working with Azure Data Lake Store is at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/dls.
